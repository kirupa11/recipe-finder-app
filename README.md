# 🍳 Recipe Finder App

The **Recipe Finder App** helps users find meals based on ingredients they already have.  
It was built as part of a take-home challenge to demonstrate React skills, API integration, and clean UI design.

## 🧠 Problem-Solving & Approach

1. **Goal** — Help user “Taylor” find recipes quickly by entering ingredients.  
2. **API Used** — [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api/json/v1/1/filter.php?i={ingredient})  
3. **Tech Stack**
   - React (for UI)
   - Tailwind CSS (for styling)
   - Fetch API (for calling TheMealDB)
4. **Steps Followed**
   - Setup React + Tailwind environment  
   - Created components: `SearchBar`, `RecipeList`, `RecipeCard`, `RecipeModal`
   - Integrated API with loading and error states
   - Styled layout with Tailwind grid and modal
   - Deployed to CodeSandbox
